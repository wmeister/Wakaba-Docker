# Wakaba-Docker
## About
Wakaba was created by Dag Ã…gren/WAHa.06x36. Description from the website:

"Wakaba is an image board script very strictly modelled after the Futaba and Futallaby scripts. Wakaba borrows quite a bit of HTML code and translated text from Futallaby.

Wakaba and Kareha are my attempts at implementing from scratch image and message boards of a type popular in Japan (used on sites such as Futaba Channel and 2channel). This kind of board software is built around anonymous posting and no requirements for registration, to make the boards more suited for casual uses, and more fun overall. They are written in Perl, and are designed to be more efficient and cleanly written than the original scripts that are available, while preserving the same kind of functionality. Both scripts are in use at iichan, an English-language site built along the same lines as the Japanese Futaba Channel, and also 4-ch, an English-language discussion BBS."
